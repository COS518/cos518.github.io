## Publishing
First, install ```jekyll``` (e.g., via ```./bin/install```). Then, run the following
```
./bin/publish -m [COMMIT_MESSAGE]
```
This will add all untracked files (```git add .```) and tracked changes (```git commit -am```), build the site, push to GitHub, and push to ```cycles```.

## TODO
- Decide on 3/13, 5/03 lectures
- Have students sign up for papers
- Format of how to give presentation
- Determine group sizes
- Where / how to publish final project repots
